# Desktop Forms App
This is a Windows Desktop application built using Visual Basic. The app allows users to create and view submissions with a stopwatch feature, and it interacts with a backend server to save and retrieve data. This application is a part of an assignment and is not completely functional.

## Features

- **View Submissions**: Browse through previously submitted forms.
- **Create New Submission**: Fill out a new form with Name, Email, Phone Number, and GitHub repo link.
- **Stopwatch**: Start, pause, and resume a stopwatch without resetting it.
